# App Instance

App instance is the core of a Spry.

The core of a Spry is an `app` instance. It is the core of the server that handles incoming requests. You can use app instance to register event handlers.

## Initializing an app

You can create a new Spry app instance using `createSpry` utility:

```dart
final app = createSpry();
```

## Registering event handlers

You can register [event handlers](/guide/event-handler) to app instance stack use `app.use`:

```dart
app.use((event) => 'Hello Spry!');
```

## Routing
